# Marktonator!

A fun game about clicking! Mark

For now, this code's all messy and stuff so yeahh i will prolly fix that at a later point, if it's not messy, then you didn't see this.

Also HUGEEE props to the kaboom server for helping me, and to [LajBel](lajbel.land) for helping me on build stuff and that shit

Made with **Javascript** and **Kaboom.js** in the span of a week / week and a half
