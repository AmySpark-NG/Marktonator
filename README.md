## - About -
This code it's all messy and all in only one file but i really didn't wanted to bother myself with that, it's already enough of an achievement to have finished this game, actually it has kinda of its own merit to have made the game in 800 lines of code

Anyways _HUGEEE_ props to the kaboom server for helping me, and to [LajBel](lajbel.land) for helping me on build stuff and that shit, also thanks to him for the Kaboom.js x Newgrounds integration, it was hard to understand at first but i kinda did in the end

Made with **Javascript** using **Kaboom.js** in the span of a week / week and a half, entry for the [MARKJAM#1](markjam.repl.co)
